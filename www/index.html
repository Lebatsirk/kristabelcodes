			<div class="box2"><p>I've been delaying adding this site's URL to my LinkedIn profile and other places because it was a work in progress.  I have ideas of what I want to do here, including (but not limited to): </p>
			<ul>
			<li>displaying static and interactive versions of my CV,</li>
			<li>showcasing my CSS skills (including the use of css grid),</li>
			<li>demonstrating knowledge of database connectivity with PHP and SQL,</li>
			<li>including aria landmark features and design choices that highlight my understanding of accessibility and usability, and</li>
			<li>adding small portfolio projects to demonstrate my problem-solving, coding, and commenting skills</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="box3">...but I've been getting in my own way.</div>
			<div class="box4"><p>I'm the first to admit that I can be a bit of a perfectionist. I like things to be right before being judged, but I'm aware that the real world rarely provides the time for this.</p><p>During the final project for my degree I learned to set myself sub-deadlines to help address this tendency while maintaining my motiviation.</p><p>So in the spirit of accepting that "in progress" is not a bad thing, but simply indicates something that is developing, changing, (or perhaps even evolving?) I have decided to make this a feature of my website!</div>
			<div class="box5"><p>I've applied to study for a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from next autumn (more about this will follow!) so over the coming months I intend to do the following things, documenting my progress along the way and sharing it with whoever views this site.</p></div>
			<div class="box6"><ul><li>Improve my Python skills by completing relevant courses on Codecademy and sharing the code I come up with during activities on here</li>
			<li>Refresh and learn new maths skills, including statistics, probability, linear algebra, and calculus (as recommended by current MSc students at UoB during the open day and also from online reading)</li>
			<li>Convert my CV into different data structure formats, e.g. XML/JSON and create something dynamic on this site for viewers to interact with the parts of my CV they wish to see</li>
			<!-- <li>Continue to learn React because I'm fascinated by its flexibility and potential for building websites without some of the limitations offered by more traditional methods of web development</li> -->
			<li>Do all this with source control on Github to document the journey whilst becoming more comfortable with Github itself</li>
			<li>...anything else interesting that I think of!</li></ul>
			<p>I almost stopped here, thinking that I couldn't upload this until I was sure I'd included everything on this list but then I changed the final item after reminding myself that there is nothing wrong with an incomplete list.</p></div>
			<div class="box7">FYI, the rainbow colours are a current bit of fun to make the dynamic display obvious until I change it to something more "classy"</div>
