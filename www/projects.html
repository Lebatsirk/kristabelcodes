          Listed here are a selection of completed and in-progress projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently have several in-progress projects because since graduating I have been working on improving existing skills and developing new ones. My focus changes depending on the priority of current demands, e.g. if I have an interview coming up for a job using a particular technology, I'll focus on the most relevant skills for that role.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to this, I'm cementing my understanding with practical
          projects, gaining Codecademy certifications for verification of my learning, and building a portfolio to demonstrate my technical skills.

          <li><a href="kristabel_codes_original" target="_blank">Early 2024 version of site</a><br />Some of the projects below refer to refactoring of this website, but in April 2024 I re-worked the basic design and style of the site to apply some newly-learnt CSS. When I complete the refactoring, I will also change the styling to match the new version, but in the meantime here is the older version for comparison when looking at the projects.</li><br />
				<li><a href="kristabel-codes-react" target="_blank">kristabelcodes using React (work in progress!)</a><br />
          I'm currently refactoring this site into a version using React at the same time as learning React.<br /><br />
          Update (2nd May): this has been put on hold while I work on higher priority tasks, and currently just consists of the main (original) site layout using React components to build the navbar link items so I could understand how to pass in props or use default values if empty, etc. You can see what I've done using the Google Developer Tools if you're interested. <em>To be continued!</em></li><br />
				<li><a href="../ca_ravenous/" target="_blank">Codecademy Ravenous Project (part 1 of 4 in progress!)</a><br />26/03/2024 : Latest update is figuring out Bootstrap, hence the odd colours at the moment!</li><br />
				<li><a href="project_reactforum.html" target="_blank">Codecademy Project - React Forum</a></li>
				<br />
				<li><a href="php_site/index.php" target="_blank">kristabelcodes using PHP (work in progress!)</a><br />I'm currently (April 2024) learning/refreshing my PHP skills, so to consolidate that I've dabbled with refactoring this site with PHP. Notable differences so far are using includes for code reuse and iterating through an array of skills on the CV page. Need to look into the best way to get fonts and css grid displaying correctly on the css page.</li><br />
