				<div class="cv_heading">Personal statement</div>
				<p>Having recently decided to return to work following a break to raise my family, my recent study has enriched my previously self-taught skills, providing background understanding to support those skills and allowing me to gain up-to-date knowledge of current practices.  Varying levels of technical experience and theoretical understanding were gained during my education, previous employment, and personal projects.  A fundamental grasp of object-oriented and procedural programming combined with my proven ability to independently and rapidly acquire and develop new skills puts me in an ideal position to apply myself to a variety of roles. Additionally, the soft skills developed during my time parenting, volunteering, and studying will no doubt be invaluable during my future career.</p>
