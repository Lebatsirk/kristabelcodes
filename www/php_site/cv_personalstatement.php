          Having recently decided to return to work following a break to raise
          my family, my recent study has enriched my previously self-taught
          skills, providing background understanding to support those skills and
          allowing me to gain up-to-date knowledge of current practices. Varying
          levels of technical experience and theoretical understanding were
          gained during my education, previous employment, and personal
          projects. A fundamental grasp of object-oriented and procedural
          programming combined with my proven ability to independently and
          rapidly acquire and develop new skills puts me in an ideal position to
          apply myself to a variety of roles. Additionally, the soft skills
          developed during my time parenting, volunteering, and studying will no
          doubt be invaluable during my future career.
